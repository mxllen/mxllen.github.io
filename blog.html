	  <h4><u><b>Trying to suck less I guess</b></u></h4>
	  <p>Alright, how do I start?<br><br>I haven't really been updating this website for a while or learned anything in regards to coding. I have also been lazy in terms of music production, all of those things are fine I guess, but I wish I had acted less lazy over these few months. I've wanted to make more music, but instead of doing stuff I just procrastinate and I am sure that can't be beneficial for me, especially considering that I have been acting lazy at college as well, only doing the least amount of work necessary and not learning a lot. I get by and pass, but my grades should be above average if I want to make the most out of this. I've set myself the goal to at least try to be a little less lazy, study school material, mess around with music and occasionally figure learn more about coding, this is what I should be doing and I hopefully will. I don't want to complain here about the same issues in a few months. Right after I manage to fix my laziness I will try to develop a healthier diet perhaps or at least figure out how to manage my sleep better.<br><br>In other news, I went to a concert in Berlin, one of the best nights I probably have ever experienced! I took a train there for the Haunted Mound concert and well... I ended up missing the last train that night, so I had to spend 6 hours in a McDonald's, but the mosh pit was so insane that night that it was totally worth it, my key chain also ended up ripping, but luckily I could easily replace the missing link.<br><br>I would really love to write more about that day but I still suck at blogging and writing interesting texts so I will keep it short for now.  Also, it's close to 2 AM and I should really sleep, at least I'm good at stalling and wasting time... hey it's something I guess!?</p>

	  <h4><u><b>New goals</b></u></h4>
	  <p>I haven't really been feeling like myself lately. I struggled a lot over the past few years, a lot of stuff happened, but I also made some progress. I decided recently that I don't want to keep living my life like this, I want to progress and learn more. I am now trying to get my Fachabi and after that I will try to get an apprenticeship, either in a Bank or perhaps something in IT, if things change I could still study if I want to. But the reasons as to why I have changed my mind on doing the Abitur fully till the end are simple. I am 24 years old now and haven't enjoyed life as much as I could have. I want to travel and experience new things, and for all of this I will need money, so I decided to get a part-time job on the side until I graduate. things are looking good, I recently got an appointment for a job interview in customer support.  I could work from home! <br><br> Also I will try to teach myself some coding stuff, I am currently starting out with HTML and CSS,  and maybe I will get into Javascript at some point too. After that I might get into other programming languages, all of this will hopefully be useful in the future. Perhaps I will actually end up working in IT and if not, well, still a cool skill to be able to code I suppose. <br><br> Anyways, I am also going to keep learning more about sound design and music production, as music is still a very big hobby of mine. I will keep playing video games, at least those I do enjoy, idk why, but they do keep me afloat and help a lot with coping with all my mental struggles and trauma. I have lots of stuff to process, like all the stuff that happened in my childhood and my brother's death, but I swear those things won't hold me back, I will keep fighting for a better future! <br><br> Not sure how often I will update this blog, but at least once in a while or so, let's see how things will develop over the next months. I am really looking forward to summer. <br><br> With all of that said, have a nice day and see you next time!</p>
