	  <h4><u>New goals</u></h4>
	  <p>I haven't really been feeling like myself lately, i struggled a lot over the past few years, a lot of stuff happened, but i also made some progress. I decided recently that i don't want to keep living my life like this, i want to progress and learn more. I am now trying to get my Fachabi and after that i will try to get an apprenticeship, either in a Bank or perhaps something in IT, if things change i could still study if i want to. But the reasons as to why i have changed my mind on doing the Abitur fully till the end are simple, i am 24 years old now and haven't really enjoyed life as much as i could've have, i want to travel and experience new things. For all of this i will need money, so i decided i will get a part time job on the side until i graduate, things are looking good, i recently got an appointment for a job interview in customer support, i could work from home! <br><br> Also i will try to teach myself some coding stuff, i am currently starting out with HTML and CSS, maybe i will get in to Javascript at some point too, after that i might get in to Python or C++, all of this will hopefully be useful in the future, maybe i will actually end up working in the IT field and if not, well, still a cool skill to be able to code i suppose. <br><br> Anyway, i am also going to keep learning more about sound design and music production, as music is still a very very big hobby of mine, gonna keep playing videogames, at least those i do enjoy and also gonna keep watching anime, no one can stop me from that, idk why, but these things really keep me afloat and help a lot with coping with all my mental struggles and trauma, i have lots of stuff to process, like all the stuff that happened in my childhood and my brother's death, but i swear those things won't hold me back, i will keep fighting for a better future! <br><br> Not sure how often i will update this blog, but at least once in a while or so, let's see how things will develop over the next months, i am really looking forward to summer. <br><br> With all of that said, have a nice day and see ya next time.</p>
