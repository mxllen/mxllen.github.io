	  <h4><u><b>Trying to suck less i guess</b></u></h4>
	  <p>Alright how do i start?<br><br>I haven't really been updating this website for a while or really learning anything regarding coding, also i have been lazy in regards to music production, all of those things are fine i guess, but i really wish i had acted less lazy over these few months. I really want to make more music, but instead of doing stuff i just procrastinate and i am sure that can't be beneficial for me, especially considering that i have been acting lazy at college as well, only doing the least and not learning a lot, i get by and pass, but my grades should be above average if i really want to make the most out of this. I've set myself the goal to at least try to be a little less lazy, study school material, mess around with music and ocassionally figure out how to code, this is what i should be doing and i hopefully will, i don't want to complain on here about the same issues in a few months. Right after i managed to fix my lazyness i will try to develop a healthier diet perhaps or at least figure out how to manage my sleep better.<br><br>In other News, i went to a concert in Berlin, one of the best nights i probably have ever experienced! I took a train there for the Haunted Mound concert and well... I also ended up missing the last train that night, so i had to spend 6 hours in a McDonald's, but the mosh pit was so insane that night that it was totally worth it, my key chain also ended up ripping, but luckily i could easily replace the missing link.<br><br>I would really love to write more about that day but i still suck at properly blogging and writing interesting texts so i will keep it short for now, also it's close to 2AM and i should really sleep, at least i'm good at stalling and wasting time... hey it's something i guess!?</p>

	  <h4><u><b>New goals</b></u></h4>
	  <p>I haven't really been feeling like myself lately, i struggled a lot over the past few years, a lot of stuff happened, but i also made some progress. I decided recently that i don't want to keep living my life like this, i want to progress and learn more. I am now trying to get my Fachabi and after that i will try to get an apprenticeship, either in a Bank or perhaps something in IT, if things change i could still study if i want to. But the reasons as to why i have changed my mind on doing the Abitur fully till the end are simple, i am 24 years old now and haven't really enjoyed life as much as i could've have, i want to travel and experience new things. For all of this i will need money, so i decided i will get a part time job on the side until i graduate, things are looking good, i recently got an appointment for a job interview in customer support, i could work from home! <br><br> Also i will try to teach myself some coding stuff, i am currently starting out with HTML and CSS, maybe i will get in to Javascript at some point too, after that i might get in to other programming languages, all of this will hopefully be useful in the future, maybe i will actually end up working in the IT field and if not, well, still a cool skill to be able to code i suppose. <br><br> Anyway, i am also going to keep learning more about sound design and music production, as music is still a very very big hobby of mine, gonna keep playing videogames, at least those i do enjoy and also gonna keep watching anime, no one can stop me from that, idk why, but these things really keep me afloat and help a lot with coping with all my mental struggles and trauma, i have lots of stuff to process, like all the stuff that happened in my childhood and my brother's death, but i swear those things won't hold me back, i will keep fighting for a better future! <br><br> Not sure how often i will update this blog, but at least once in a while or so, let's see how things will develop over the next months, i am really looking forward to summer. <br><br> With all of that said, have a nice day and see ya next time! ^^</p>
